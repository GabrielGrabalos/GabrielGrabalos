## 🌱 Currently Learning

Just like technology never stops advancing, I **never stop learning**. While I study what my school provides me, I also like to explore everything I can. Currently, I'm interested in artificial intelligence, especially generative models, and cloud computing platforms like Firebase, AWS, and Azure for developing secure database-driven applications. Also, I'm just waiting for the opportunity to start practicing Spring Boot! 🍃

- 📖 I have a great love for **storytelling** and creating stories. I believe this passion helps me create apps that feel like a journey!
- 🥷 I once practiced **Kung-Fu** when I was 8 years old. Didn't last much, but it definitely happened. **〜(￣▽￣〜)**
