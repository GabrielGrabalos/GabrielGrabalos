## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

Just like technology never stops advancing, I never stop learning. While I study what my school provides me, I also like to explore everything I can. Currently, I'm interested in artificial intelligence, especially generative models, and cloud computing platforms like Firebase, AWS, and Azure for developing secure database-driven applications.
